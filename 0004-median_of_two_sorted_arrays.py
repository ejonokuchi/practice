#
# There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.
#
# Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity
# should be O(log (m+n)).
#
# You may assume nums1 and nums2Â cannot be both empty.
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# nums1 = [1, 3]
# nums2 = [2]
#
# The median is 2.0
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# nums1 = [1, 2]
# nums2 = [3, 4]
#
# The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5

        Returns the median of two sorted arrays in log-time.

        Let A and B be the two input arrays, where A is smaller (or same size).
        Let |A| = n, and |B| = m.

        Imagine the hypothetical array C (of size n + m) that would result from
        a linear-time merge of A and B. The global median is the last and
        largest element of the first half of C (or the average of this and the
        next element, in the case of an even number of elements).

        Let i be the exact number of elements contributed by A to the first
        half of C. If i is known, the number of elements from B is known, and
        because A and B are sorted, the median is also known (the largest of
        the values from A and B).

        We run a binary search for i in the range [0, n]

        Thus, the time-complexity of this algorithm is O(log(n + m)).

        An alternate (and very practical) approach is the below one-liner:
        >>> return self.median(sorted(A + B))  # timsort!

        """
        # Ensure A is smaller
        n, m = len(A), len(B)
        if n > m:
            A, B, n, m = B, A, m, n

        # Empty array cases
        if n == 0:
            return self.median(B)

        # Search for i, the number of elements A contributes to C
        mid_C = (n + m + 1) // 2
        min_i, max_i = 0, n  # i in the range [0, n]

        while min_i <= max_i:
            i = (min_i + max_i) // 2
            j = mid_C - i

            if i < n and A[i] < B[j - 1]:  # i too small
                min_i = i + 1
            elif i > 0 and A[i - 1] > B[j]:  # i too large
                max_i = i - 1
            else:  # i is correct
                if i == 0:
                    left_max = B[j-1]
