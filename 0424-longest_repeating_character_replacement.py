# Testcase Example:  '"ABAB"\n2'
#
# You are given a string s and an integer k. You can choose any character of
# the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can
# perform this operation at most k times.
# 
# Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can
# get after performing the above operations.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
# Output: 4
# Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
# Output: 4
# Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
# The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
# s consists of only uppercase English letters.
# 0 <= k <= s.length
# 
# 
#
