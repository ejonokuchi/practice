# Testcase Example:  '[["o","a","a","n"],["e","t","a","e"],["i","h","k","r"],["i","f","l","v"]]\n'
# + '["oath","pea","eat","rain"]'
#
# Given an m x n boardÂ of characters and a list of strings words, return all
# words on the board.
#
# Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells,
# where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same
# letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: board =
# [["o","a","a","n"],["e","t","a","e"],["i","h","k","r"],["i","f","l","v"]],
# words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"]
# Output: ["eat","oath"]
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: board = [["a","b"],["c","d"]], words = ["abcb"]
# Output: []
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# m == board.length
# n == board[i].length
# 1 <= m, n <= 12
# board[i][j] is a lowercase English letter.
# 1 <= words.length <= 3 * 10^4
# 1 <= words[i].length <= 10
# words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
# All the strings of words are unique.

        matches an entry at the current sub-trie.

        enables one search to cover both words, only branching when they differ.
